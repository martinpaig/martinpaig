Kia ora ðŸ˜„ , I want to be a developer and I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity. I am excited by the range of industries that both of these sectors are applicable to.

I'm currently studying and keep track of my assignments and personal projects on here! My university assignments are private projects (so as to not publish answers publicly!)
Some of the languages I have experience in are Java, Python, C, C++, SQL, R, and HTML and I am keen to build on my skills across these.
