Kia ora ğŸ˜„ , I want to be a developer and I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity. I am excited by the range of industries that both of these sectors are applicable to.

I'm currently studying and keep track of my assignments and personal projects on here! 
Some of the languages I have used are C, C++, Java, Processing and HTML, and I am keen to build on my skills across these.
